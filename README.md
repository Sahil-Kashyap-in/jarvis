J.A.R.V.I.S 

A personal assistant made as an experiment to have the feel of AI built by my own, In this repository i'll just be adding a basic version of JARVIS.

Source of Learning : YouTube (Went through several videos and built)

What are the possible stuufs JARVIS of this version can do ?
It can send emails on your behalf.
It can play music for you.
It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
It is capable of opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser.
It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.
And that was it ! (There are endless possibilities get your task done and i have took it to the advanced level as well but for now i'm still working on it so this version will be more than enough to serve the purpose)
